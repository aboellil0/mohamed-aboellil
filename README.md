# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

## Table of Contents

## Instructions

* [All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.]
* [All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers]
* [Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.]
* [Section Active State should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.]
* [When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.]
