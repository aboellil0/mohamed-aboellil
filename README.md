# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

## Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [sources](#sources)

## Instructions

* All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
* All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers
* Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.
* Section Active State should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
* When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
